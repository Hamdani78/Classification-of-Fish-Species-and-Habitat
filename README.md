# Classification of Fish Species and Habitat

A Computer Vision project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify **31 species of fish** from uploaded images. This web application is built using **Flask** and is ready for deployment on **Railway**.

---

## Features

- Upload fish images and get predicted **species** and **habitat (freshwater or saltwater)**.
- Shows prediction **confidence percentage**.
- Built-in Flask interface with upload & result preview.
- Model trained with image classification using TensorFlow/Keras.

### 2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How It Works

- Image is uploaded and preprocessed to size (224x224).
- Image passed into pre-trained CNN model (`model_ikan.h5`).
- Model outputs prediction and confidence score.
- Species is mapped using `class_indices.json`.
- Habitat is determined from internal dictionary (`habitat_dict`).

## Dataset

**Source:** [Fish Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/markdaniellampa/fish-dataset)

**Description:** This dataset contains thousands of labeled images of **31 fish species**, including both freshwater and saltwater fish, captured under various lighting conditions and angles. It was used to train the classification model.
